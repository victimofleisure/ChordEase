<h3>Chart view</h3>

<p>The chart view displays the chord progression of the current <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a>, and indicates the current <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm#Song_position">song position</a>. The chart view also lets you edit the song, using standard <a href="../Menus/Edit/Editing.htm">editing</a> commands, e.g. <a href="../Menus/Edit/Copy.htm">copy</a>, <a href="../Menus/Edit/Cut.htm">cut</a>, <a href="../Menus/Edit/Paste.htm">paste</a>, etc. To insert a new chord, use the <a href="../Menus/Edit/Insert.htm">insert</a> command. To modify an existing chord, double-click it, or select it and press the <span class="key">Enter</span> key. You can also <a href="../Menus/Edit/Rename.htm">rename</a> a chord. For additional methods, see the table below. Chords can be reordered by dragging and dropping them.

<p>Multiple selection is supported: you can copy, cut, paste, delete, rename, or drag a range of chords. To select a single chord, left-click it. To select a range of chords, left-click the first chord in the range, and then while holding down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key, left-click the last chord in the range. The arrow keys move the current position, as do the <span class="key">Page Up</span>, <span class="key">Page Down</span>, <span class="key">Home</span>, and <span class="key">End</span> keys. These keys can also be used to select a range of chords, by combining them with the <span class="key">Shift</span> key.

<p>The chart view has a context menu, which includes the <a href="../Menus/Edit/Editing.htm">editing</a> commands, as well as the commands for creating and modifying <a href="../Concepts/Sections.htm">sections</a>. If the song is <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Transpose">transposed</a>, the chart view displays the transposed chords. Advanced users may prefer to <a href="../Menus/File/Edit_Text.htm">edit songs as text</a>.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Goal</th><th>Method</th></tr>
<tr><td>Change a chord's root</td><td>Right-click the chord to show the context menu, select <span class="cmd">Root</span>, and then select the desired root from the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Change a chord's type</td><td>Right-click the chord to show the context menu, select <span class="cmd">Type</span>, and then select the desired chord type from the list. If the number of available <a href="../Loose_ends/Chord_types.htm">chord types</a> makes the context menu inconveniently long, you can alternatively use the <a href="../Menus/View/Chord_bar.htm">Chord bar</a> to change the chord type.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Change a chord's bass note</td><td>Right-click the chord to show the context menu, select <span class="cmd">Bass</span>, and then select the desired <a href="../Parts_bar/Bass.htm#Slash_chords">bass note</a> from the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Change a chord's duration</td><td>Right-click the chord to show the context menu, select <span class="cmd">Duration</span>, and then select the desired duration from the list. The listed durations are in measures or fractions of a measure. To specify a duration other than those listed, select "Other" to display the Duration dialog, enter the desired duration in beats, and press OK.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Edit a chord as text</td><td>Select the chord, and then select <span class="cmd">Edit/Rename</span> in the main menus or <span class="cmd">Rename</span> in the context menu, or press <span class="key">F2</span>. A popup edit control is displayed. Make your changes, and then save them by pressing <span class="key">Enter</span> or clicking anywhere outside the edit control. To cancel, press <span class="key">Esc</span>. This method lets you change the chord's root, type, and bass note, but not its duration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Edit a chord's properties</td><td>Double-click the chord, or select the chord and press the <span class="key">Enter</span> key. You can also right-click the chord to show the context menu, and select <span class="cmd">Properties</span>. The <a href="../Dialogs/Chord_Properties.htm">chord properties</a> dialog is displayed. Change the properties as desired, and then press OK to save your changes.</td></tr>
