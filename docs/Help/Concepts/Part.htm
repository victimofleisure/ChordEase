<h3>Part</h3>

<p>A <em>part</em> specifies how input notes should be <em>mapped</em> (i.e. translated) to output notes. A part includes many settings that can affect the mapping, e.g. <a href="../Parts_bar/Part_Input.htm">input</a> and <a href="../Parts_bar/Part_Output.htm">output</a> parameters, which <a href="../Concepts/Mapping_functions.htm">mapping function</a> to use, and mapping function parameters. A <a href="../Concepts/Patch.htm">patch</a> can contain any number of parts. Each part has its own independent state and can be configured differently from other parts. The existing parts are shown in the <a href="../Parts_bar/Parts_list.htm">parts list</a>, which supports the usual <a href="../Menus/Edit/Editing.htm">editing</a> commands. The selected part's settings are edited via the tabbed pages of the <a href="../Menus/View/Parts_bar.htm">parts bar</a>. Settings common to all parts are edited via the tabbed pages of the <a href="../Menus/View/Patch_bar.htm">patch bar</a>.
