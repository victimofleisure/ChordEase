<h3>Sections</h3>

<p>A section is a contiguous subset of a <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a> that repeats, either a specific number of times or indefinitely. Sections are useful for introductions, endings, interludes, vamps, breaks, etc. A section with a <a href="../Dialogs/Section_Properties_dialog.htm#Section_Repeat">repeat count</a> greater than zero loops the specified number of times, unless it's exited prematurely via the <a href="../Menus/Transport/Next_Section.htm">Next Section</a> command. A section with a repeat count of zero loops forever, or until it's exited via the Next Section command. In both the <a href="../Concepts/Chart_view.htm">chart view</a> and <a href="../Loose_ends/Song_file_format.htm">song file format</a>, a section is indicated by enclosing one or more chords in square brackets. A song can contain any number of sections, but sections can't overlap, and can't be nested.

<p>The section-related commands are located on the <span class="cmd">Section</span> submenu of the <span class="cmd">Edit</span> menu. The <span class="cmd">Section</span> submenu is also available from the chart view's context menu. To create a new section containing the selected chords, use <a href="../Menus/Edit/Section/Section_Create.htm">Section Create</a>. To delete an existing section, use <a href="../Menus/Edit/Section/Section_Delete.htm">Section Delete</a>. To edit a section's properties, including its repeat count, use <a href="../Menus/Edit/Section/Section_Properties.htm">Section Properties</a>. To view a list of all the current sections, use <a href="../Menus/Edit/Section/Section_List.htm">Section List</a>. Advanced users may prefer to create or modify sections by <a href="../Menus/File/Edit_Text.htm">editing the song as text</a>. To spontaneously repeat one or more measures, use <a href="../Menus/Transport/Start_Tag.htm">tagging</a> instead of sections.
