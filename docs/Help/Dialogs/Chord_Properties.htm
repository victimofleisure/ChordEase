<h3>Chord Properties</h3>

<p>This modal dialog lets you edit the properties of an existing chord, including its duration, root, type, and bass note. First select the desired chord in the <a href="../Concepts/Chart_view.htm">chart view</a>, and then display the dialog by selecting <span class="cmd">Properties</span> from the chart view's context menu. Adjust the properties as desired, and then press OK to save your changes. The dialog is identical to the <a href="../Dialogs/Insert_Chord.htm">Insert Chord</a> dialog, except that the insert type is disabled. A chord's root, type, and bass note can also be changed via the <a href="../Menus/View/Chord_bar.htm">Chord bar</a>.
