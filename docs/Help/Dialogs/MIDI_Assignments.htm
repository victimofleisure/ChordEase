<h3>MIDI Assignments</h3>

<p>This dialog lists all <a href="../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">MIDI targets</a> to which controllers are currently assigned. Assignments from the <a href="../Concepts/Patch.htm">patch</a> and from all the <a href="../Concepts/Part.htm">parts</a>, which are normally accessed separately, are merged. The resulting master list of assignments can be useful for debugging your MIDI setup. Assignments can be deleted by selecting one or more rows and then choosing <span class="cmd">Delete</span> from the context menu, or pressing the <span class="key">Delete</span> key. Assignments can also be edited by selecting one or more rows and then choosing <a href="../Dialogs/MIDI_Assignments.htm#MIDI_Assignment_Properties">Properties</a> from the context menu, or pressing <span class="key">Alt+Enter</span>. To display the dialog, use <span class="cmd">MIDI/Assignments</span>.

<p>The input to output <a href="../Dialogs/MIDI_Note_Mappings.htm">MIDI note mappings</a> for each part are not included in this dialog, because they have their own dialog; see below.

<a name="MIDI_Assignment_Properties"><p><b>Properties</b></a>
<p>This dialog lets you edit the properties of one or more <a href="../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">MIDI assignments</a>. It's particularly useful for changing the port and/or channel of multiple MIDI assignments at once. Any changes you make in the dialog are applied to all of the selected assignments. If the selected assignments currently have different values for a given property, that property will be blank in the dialog. To display the dialog, choose <span class="cmd">Properties</span> from the <a href="../Dialogs/MIDI_Assignments.htm">MIDI Assignments</a> dialog's context menu, or press <span class="key">Alt+Enter</span>.
