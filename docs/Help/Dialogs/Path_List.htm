<h3>Path List</h3>

<p>This dialog lets you enter and edit a list of file paths. To insert a path at the current selection, press the Insert button, or the <span class="key">Insert</span> key. A file dialog will be displayed. Navigate to the desired file, select it, and press OK. To delete a path from the list, select it and then press the Delete button, or the <span class="key">Delete</span> key. The list also can be reordered by selecting and dragging paths one by one. When you're done, press OK to save your changes, or Cancel to abandon them.
