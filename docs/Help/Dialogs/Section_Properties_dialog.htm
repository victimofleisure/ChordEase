<h3>Section Properties</h3>

<p>This dialog lets you edit the properties of an existing <a href="../Concepts/Sections.htm">section</a>, including its start position, length, repeat count, and name. To edit a section's properties, position the <a href="../Concepts/Chart_view.htm">chart view</a>'s cursor anywhere within the section, and use <span class="cmd">Edit/Section/Properties</span> or select <span class="cmd">Section/Properties</span> from the chart view's context menu.

<a name="Section_Start"><p><b>Start</b></a>
<p>This is the section's start position, in measures, beats, and ticks. Note that measures and beats are one-origin, i.e. the beginning of the <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a> is 1:1:0. The start position is rounded as needed so that section begins on a chord boundary.

<a name="Section_Length"><p><b>Length</b></a>
<p>This is the section's length, in measures, beats, and ticks. The length is rounded as needed so that section ends on a chord boundary.

<a name="Section_Repeat"><p><b>Repeat</b></a>
<p>This is the section's repeat count. A section with a repeat count greater than zero loops the specified number of times, unless it's exited prematurely via the <a href="../Menus/Transport/Next_Section.htm">Next Section</a> command. A section with a repeat count of zero loops forever, or until it's exited via the Next Section command.

<a name="Section_Name"><p><b>Name</b></a>
<p>This is the section's optional name. The name appears in the <a href="../Dialogs/Section_List_dialog.htm">Section List dialog</a> but is otherwise unused.
