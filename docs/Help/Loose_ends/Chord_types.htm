<h3>Chord types</h3>

<p>ChordEase can support any set of chord types. All chord symbols in a <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a> must be defined in the <a href="../Loose_ends/Chord_dictionary.htm">chord dictionary</a>, which is a user-editable plain text file called ChordDictionary.txt. The chord dictionary shipped with ChordEase defines the most commonly used chord symbols, and should be adequate for most users. Advanced users may want to add new symbols, or redefine existing symbols, by associating them with different <a href="../Loose_ends/Scales.htm">scales</a> and <a href="../Loose_ends/Scales.htm#Modes">modes</a>. Before <a href="../Loose_ends/Chord_dictionary.htm#Editing_the_chord_dictionary">editing the chord dictionary</a>, you should familiarize yourself with its format.
