<h3>Clipboard</h3>

<p>The clipboard is the destination for <a href="../../Menus/Edit/Cut.htm">cut</a> and <a href="../../Menus/Edit/Copy.htm">copy</a>, and the source for <a href="../../Menus/Edit/Paste.htm">paste</a>. The <a href="../../Concepts/Chart_view.htm">chart view</a> and the <a href="../../Parts_bar/Parts_list.htm">parts list</a> both support these standard <a href="../../Menus/Edit/Editing.htm">editing</a> commands, as do all edit controls. Consequently the clipboard may contain different types of data, e.g. chords from the chart view, <a href="../../Concepts/Part.htm">parts</a> from the parts list, or text from an edit control.
