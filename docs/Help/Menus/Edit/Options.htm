<h3>Options</h3>

<p>This command displays the Options dialog, which lets you edit various user preferences. The options are organized into pages by category, e.g. <a href="../../Options/Chart.htm">chart</a> options, <a href="../../Options/Options_Record.htm">record</a> options, and <a href="../../Options/Other.htm">other</a> options. To reset all options to their default states, press the Reset All button. The <a href="../../Getting_Started/Installing.htm">installed</a> version of ChordEase stores options in the registry, whereas the portable version stores them in a file (ChordEase.ini) in the same folder as the executable.
