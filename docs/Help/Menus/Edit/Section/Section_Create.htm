<h3>Create</h3>

<p>This command creates a new <a href="../../../Concepts/Sections.htm">section</a> consisting of the currently selected chords. To create a section, first select the desired chords in the <a href="../../../Concepts/Chart_view.htm">chart view</a>, and then either use <span class="cmd">Edit/Section/Create</span>, or select <span class="cmd">Section/Create</span> from the chart view's context menu. The new section's <a href="../../../Dialogs/Section_Properties_dialog.htm#Section_Repeat">repeat count</a> is initially zero, which means the section repeats indefinitely or until it's exited via the <a href="../../../Menus/Transport/Next_Section.htm">Next Section</a> command. If you want the section to repeat a specific number of times, first create it, and then use <a href="../../../Menus/Edit/Section/Section_Properties.htm">Section Properties</a> to edit its repeat count. Note that sections can't be nested.
