<h3>Transpose</h3>

<p>This command transposes the selected chords. To temporarily transpose an entire <a href="../../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a>, use the <a href="../../Patch_bar/General.htm#Transpose">transpose</a> setting instead. Unlike the transpose setting, which applies a global transposition to all songs without modifying them, the transpose command actually modifies one or more chords within the current song. The command displays a dialog that prompts the user to enter a transposition amount. The transposition amount is expressed in semitones, and ranges from &minus;11 to +11. For a list of transposition amounts and their resulting intervals, see <a href="../../Loose_ends/Relative_intervals.htm">relative intervals</a>.
