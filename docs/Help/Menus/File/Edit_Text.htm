<h3>Edit Text</h3>

<p>Use this command to edit the current <a href="../../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a> as a text file. You should familiarize yourself with the <a href="../../Loose_ends/Song_file_format.htm">song file format</a> before attempting this. Advanced users may find this method faster than using the <a href="../../Concepts/Chart_view.htm">chart view</a> editing functions. The shortcut for this command is <span class="key">Ctrl+E</span>. The command displays a simple editing dialog containing a multiline edit control. The usual clipboard <a href="../../Menus/Edit/Editing.htm">editing</a> functions are supported. The editing dialog also supports find and replace, via the following keyboard shortcuts: <span class="key">Ctrl+F</span> for Find, <span class="key">F3</span> for Find Next, and <span class="key">Ctrl+H</span> for Replace.

<p>If you prefer, you can also edit songs with an external text editor such as Notepad. Note however that if you externally edit a song, your edits won't be visible within ChordEase until you close and reopen the song. To avoid confusion, it's recommended to use the editing dialog.
