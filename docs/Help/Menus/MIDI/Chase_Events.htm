<h3>Chase Events</h3>

<p>The <span class="cmd">MIDI/Chase Events</span> command enables or disables the "chasing" of remote parameter changes. While chase is enabled, user interface elements are automatically shown as needed to make the effects of remote parameter changes obvious. Remotely controlled parameters are also known as <a href="../../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">MIDI targets</a>. When a target parameter is changed via MIDI, the corresponding control in the user interface is updated. However this update is only apparent if that control's parent page is visible. If chase is enabled, ChordEase automatically shows the appropriate page, i.e. the page within the <a href="../../Menus/View/Patch_bar.htm">patch bar</a> or <a href="../../Menus/View/Parts_bar.htm">parts bar</a> that contains the updated control. For <a href="../../Concepts/Part.htm">part</a> targets, the appropriate part is also selected in the <a href="../../Parts_bar/Parts_list.htm">parts list</a>. Note that some MIDI targets can't be chased, e.g. the transport-related targets. The Chase Events feature can be useful for debugging your MIDI setup, but it should normally be disabled to avoid confusion.
