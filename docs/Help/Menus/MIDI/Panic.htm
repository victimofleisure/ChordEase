<h3>Panic</h3>

<p>The <span class="cmd">MIDI/Panic</span> command resets all MIDI notes on all output devices, and also resets the list of mapped notes within ChordEase. This is useful for stopping stuck notes. Avoid using this command during a performance except as a last resort, because it may cause audible artifacts. The shortcut for this command is <span class="key">Shift+Esc</span>.
