<h3>Reset All Targets</h3>

<p>The <span class="cmd">MIDI/Reset All Targets</span> command resets all <a href="../../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">MIDI targets</a> to their default state. This effectively deletes all MIDI assignments. To delete an individual MIDI assignment, find the corresponding target within the <a href="../../Patch_bar/Patch_MIDI.htm">patch MIDI page</a> or <a href="../../Parts_bar/Part_MIDI.htm">part MIDI page</a>, right-click its row, and select <span class="cmd">Reset</span> in the context menu. Individual assignments can also be deleted via the <a href="../../Dialogs/MIDI_Assignments.htm">MIDI Assignments</a> dialog, by selecting one or more rows and choosing <span class="cmd">Delete</span> in the context menu.
