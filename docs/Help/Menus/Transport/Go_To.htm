<h3>Go To</h3>

<p>This command jumps to a specified position within the <a href="../../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a>. The command displays a modal dialog, which prompts you to enter a numeric <a href="../../Concepts/Song.htm#Song_position">song position</a> in measures, beats, and ticks. Note that measures and beats are one-origin, i.e. the beginning of the song is 1:1:0. If the desired position is on a beat boundary you may omit the ticks, e.g. enter 5:3 for the third beat of the fifth measure; if it's on a measure boundary you may omit both beats and ticks.
