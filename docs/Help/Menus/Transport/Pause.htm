<h3>Pause</h3>

<p>This command pauses playback, or it's already paused, resumes it. Unlike <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Play-Stop.htm">Play/Stop</a>, pausing doesn't rewind or otherwise affect the <a href="../../Concepts/Song.htm#Song_position">song position</a>, and resuming doesn't play a <a href="../../Patch_bar/General.htm#Lead-in">lead-in</a>.
