<h3>Play/Stop</h3>

<p>This command toggles <a href="../../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a> playback between the playing and stopped states. If <a href="../../Patch_bar/General.htm#Lead-in">Lead-in</a> is non-zero, the specified number of lead-in measures are played before the song begins. If <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Auto_Rewind.htm">Auto Rewind</a> is enabled, stopping automatically rewinds back to the beginning of the song.
