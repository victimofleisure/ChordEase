<h3>Previous Chord</h3>

<p>This command skips backward to the previous chord within the <a href="../../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a>. Note that this isn't necessarily the previous measure: the actual distance moved depends on the previous chord's duration. This command is particularly useful when performing in free time, i.e. with the song <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Play-Stop.htm">stopped</a>. This command is a likely candidate for <a href="../../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">remote control</a>. To skip forward, use <a href="../../Menus/Transport/Next_Chord.htm">Next Chord</a>.
