<h3>Record</h3>

<p>This command starts or stops a <a href="../../Concepts/Recording.htm">recording</a>. By default, you're prompted for an output filename, but if you prefer "one touch" recording, uncheck the <a href="../../Options/Options_Record.htm#Prompt_for_filename">prompt for filename</a> option. It's also possible to <a href="../../Options/Options_Record.htm#Always_record">always record</a>, in which case the Record command is superfluous and gives the error message "Locked to always record." To play back the completed recording, use the <a href="../../Dialogs/Record_Player_dialog.htm">Record Player dialog</a>, or play the MIDI file in a suitable application; also see <a href="../../Concepts/Recording.htm#Record_output_files">record output files</a>.
