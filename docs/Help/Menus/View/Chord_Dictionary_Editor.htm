<h3>Chord Dictionary</h3>

<p>This command displays the <a href="../../Dialogs/Chord_Dictionary_dialog.htm">Chord Dictionary dialog</a>. The dialog lets you edit the <a href="../../Loose_ends/Chord_dictionary.htm">chord dictionary</a> via a tabular interface, which is typically more convenient than using a text editor. The dialog is modeless, so the rest of the application's user interface is accessible while the dialog is open.
