<h3>Parts bar</h3>

<p>This command shows or hides the Parts bar. The parts bar lets you create <a href="../../Concepts/Part.htm">parts</a> and edit their settings. The parts bar has two panes. The left-hand pane contains the <a href="../../Parts_bar/Parts_list.htm">parts list</a> which lists the existing parts. The right-hand pane contains various tabbed pages of settings, which correspond to the currently selected part. The parts bar includes the following pages:
