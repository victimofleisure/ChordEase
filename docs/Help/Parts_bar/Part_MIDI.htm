<h3>MIDI</h3>

<p>This page lists the part <a href="../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">MIDI targets</a>. Each row corresponds to a <a href="../Concepts/Part.htm">part</a> parameter or command that can be remotely controlled via MIDI. Each part has its own MIDI targets, and only the current part's targets are shown. To view the targets for a different part, select it in the <a href="../Parts_bar/Parts_list.htm">parts list</a>. In order to remotely control a MIDI target, you must first assign a MIDI message to it. MIDI assignments can be created by editing the items on this page, though it's usually easier to have ChordEase <a href="../Menus/MIDI/Learn.htm">learn</a> the assignments. This page also lets you change or delete existing MIDI assignments. For additional information, see the <a href="../Patch_bar/Patch_MIDI.htm">Patch MIDI</a> page, which works similarly. For information about each target, see the <a href="../Loose_ends/MIDI_target_list.htm">MIDI target list</a>.
