<h3>General</h3>

<p>This <a href="../Concepts/Patch.htm">patch</a> page contains general settings that have systemwide effects.

<a name="Tempo"><p><b>Tempo</b></a>
<p>This is the speed at which the current <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a> is <a href="../Menus/Transport/Play-Stop.htm">played</a>, in beats per minute (BPM). Fractional tempos are allowed. This setting also affects timing parameters that accept note durations, such as <a href="../Parts_bar/Part_Output.htm#Harmonic_Anticipation">harmonic anticipation</a> and <a href="../Parts_bar/Comp.htm#Arpeggio_Period">arpeggio period</a>. This setting is the <em>nominal</em> tempo; the actual tempo is influenced by the <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Tempo_Multiple">tempo multiple</a> (see below) and therefore may differ from this setting. The actual tempo is displayed in the <a href="../Menus/View/Status_bar.htm">status bar</a>. A song may optionally specify a tempo (see <a href="../Dialogs/Song_Properties.htm">song properties</a>), in which case the song's tempo overrides the patch tempo. Tempo can also be specified via <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Tap_Tempo">tapping</a>.

<a name="Tempo_Multiple"><p><b>Tempo Multiple</b></a>
<p>This is a scaling factor which is applied to the <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Tempo">tempo</a> setting (see above). The actual tempo is the product of the tempo and the tempo multiple. The actual tempo is displayed in the <a href="../Menus/View/Status_bar.htm">status bar</a>. Tempo multiple is especially useful if your songs all specify different tempos, and you want to <a href="../Menus/Transport/Play-Stop.htm">play</a> them all faster or slower by the same percentage. Instead of editing each song's tempo, you can simply adjust the tempo multiple. Because it's independent of song tempos and scales them proportionally, tempo multiple provides a convenient means of adjusting tempo during a performance, e.g. <a href="../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">remotely</a> via a MIDI controller.

<a name="Key"><p><b>Key</b></a>
<p>This is the transposed key signature of the current <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a>. It shows the sum of the song's key signature and the <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Transpose">transpose</a> setting (see below). Transposition can be accomplished either by selecting a different key, or by adjusting the transpose setting. The key and transpose settings are automatically synchronized with each other and have the same effect, so use whichever method is more convenient. If transpose is zero (no transposition), the song's actual key signature is shown. The transposed key signature is also displayed in the <a href="../Menus/View/Status_bar.htm">status bar</a>.

<a name="Transpose"><p><b>Transpose</b></a>
<p>This is the amount to transpose the current <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a> by, in semitones. The amount may be positive or negative. If it's zero, the song is <a href="../Menus/Transport/Play-Stop.htm">played</a> in its original key. This setting is automatically synchronized with the <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Key">key</a> setting (see above). Transposition can be accomplished by either method. The transpose setting is useful for transposing by an interval, whereas the key setting is useful when the desired key is known. Note that it's possible to transpose during a performance, e.g. <a href="../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">remotely</a> via a MIDI controller. A song may optionally specify a transposition (see <a href="../Dialogs/Song_Properties.htm">song properties</a>), in which case the song's transposition overrides the patch transposition. To permanently transpose one or more chords within the current song, use the <a href="../Menus/Edit/Transpose_Selection.htm">Edit/Transpose</a> command instead. For a list of transposition amounts and their resulting intervals, see <a href="../Loose_ends/Relative_intervals.htm">relative intervals</a>.

<a name="PPQ"><p><b>PPQ</b></a>
<p>This is the time resolution, in pulses per quarter note. It affects all time-related functions. Higher PPQ values increase the accuracy of note durations and timing parameters such as <a href="../Parts_bar/Comp.htm#Arpeggio_Period">arpeggio period</a>, but at the cost of decreasing the granularity of the <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Tempo">tempo</a> setting. Large PPQ values will reduce the number of available tempos, particularly faster tempos, and may cause the error message "Can't create timer." Though a wide range of PPQ values are permitted, values greater than 48 are not recommended. The default PPQ is 24. Note that if <a href="../Patch_bar/Sync.htm#Sync_to_MIDI_clock">Sync to MIDI clock</a> is enabled, PPQ is restricted to 24 and can't be edited.

<a name="Lead-in"><p><b>Lead-in</b></a>
<p>This is the length of the lead-in, or count-off, in measures. If it's non-zero, the <a href="../Patch_bar/Metronome.htm">metronome</a> plays for the specified period before the <a href="../Concepts/Song.htm">song</a> actually starts. This allows the performer(s) to be in sync with the tempo by the time the song begins.

<a name="Tag_Length"><p><b>Tag Length</b></a>
<p>This is the length of a tag, in measures. Tagging is the spontaneous repetition of one or more measures. Note that this parameter only affects <em>subsequent</em> tags; it has no effect on a tag that's already in progress. For more information, see the <a href="../Menus/Transport/Start_Tag.htm">Start Tag</a> command.

<a name="Tag_Repeat"><p><b>Tag Repeat</b></a>
<p>This is the number of times to repeat a tag, or zero for indefinite repeat. Tagging is the spontaneous repetition of one or more measures. Note that this parameter only affects <em>subsequent</em> tags; it has no effect on a tag that's already in progress. For more information, see the <a href="../Menus/Transport/Start_Tag.htm">Start Tag</a> command.

<a name="Tap_Tempo"><p><b>Tap Tempo</b></a>
<p>Tap tempo lets you specify the <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Tempo">tempo</a> by tapping instead of numerically. To tap a tempo, repeatedly press the Tap Tempo button on the beat of the desired tempo. Alternatively you can use the <span class="key">Ctrl+M</span> shortcut, or a MIDI controller assigned to the Tap Tempo <a href="../Concepts/MIDI_targets.htm">MIDI target</a>. At least two taps are necessary to establish a tempo. Additional taps may improve the accuracy, because taps are averaged. To clear the running average and start over, wait at least two seconds. Tempos slower than 30 BPM must be entered numerically. To adjust the tempo while playing, tap once exactly on the beat, and then tap slightly ahead of the following beat to speed up, or slightly behind it to slow down. Note that if a <a href="../Patch_bar/General.htm#Tempo_Multiple">tempo multiple</a> is in effect (i.e. tempo multiple has any value other than one), tapping still works, but the tempo shown in the <a href="../Menus/View/Patch_bar.htm">patch bar</a> isn't the actual tempo; the <a href="../Menus/View/Status_bar.htm">status bar</a> shows the actual tempo, taking tempo multiple into account.
